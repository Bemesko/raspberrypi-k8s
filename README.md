# Kubernetes in my Raspberry Pi

- This is an ongoing project which is me trying to install Kubernetes on my Raspberry Pi 3.
- My goal with this is to familiarize myself more deeply with `kubeadm` and the on premises Kubernetes workflow.
- I also want to provide as much configuration/infrastructure as code so I can reproduce my setup from scratch if (when) I break anything.
